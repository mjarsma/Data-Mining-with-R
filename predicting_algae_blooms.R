# Multiple linear regression obtains an additive function 
# relating a target variable to a set of predictor variables.

algae <- algae[-manyNAs(algae), ]

# knnImputation fills in all NA values using the
# k nearest neighbours and obtains a weighted average
# (eucledian distance) of their values to fill in 
# the unknowns. Thus, clean.algae has no missing
# variable values.
clean.algae <- knnImputation(algae, k = 10)

clean.algae

# the first argument of lm() indicates the functional
# form of the model: the model predicts the variable a1
# using all other variables present in the data, which
# is the meaning of the dot character. the data parameter
# sets the data sample to be used to obtain the model.
lm.a1 <- lm(a1 ~ .,data=clean.algae[,1:12])

# * Residuals: the residuals are the difference between
# the actual values of the variable you're predicting and
# predicted values from the regression y-y^. For most regressions,
# you want your residuals to look like a normal distribution
# when plotted. 
# Estimated coefficient: an increase of 1 unit in a1 with 
# an increase of e.g. 1.0526 in mn02.
# * Regression coefficients represent the mean change in 
# the response variable for one unit of change in the predictor 
# variable while holding other predictors in the model constant.
# The key to understanding the coefficients is to think of them 
# as slopes, and theyâ€™re often called slope coefficients.
# * t-value: score that measures whether or not the coefficient
# for this variable 
# * The p-value for each term tests the null hypothesis that 
# the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A low p-value 
# (< 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. 
# In other words, a predictor that has a low p-value is likely 
# to be a meaningful addition to your model because changes in 
# the predictor's value are related to changes in the response 
# variable.
# * Multiple R-squared: metric for evaluating the goodness of fit of 
# the model. Higher value is better with 1 being the best.
# The adjusted coefficient is more demanding as it takes into
# account the number of parameters of the regression model, as in
# it adds a penalty for adding variables to the model that are
# uncorrelated with the variable you're trying to explain.
# Corresponds with the amount of variability in what is
# being predicted with the model. Correlation does not always
# imply causality. Approximately 37% of variation in a1
# can be explained by all variables (the dot notation).
# * F-statistics and resulting p-value: the statistic of 
# the hypothesis test with null hypothesis. H0: All non-constant 
# coefficients in the regression equation are zero (there is no 
# dependence of the target variable on any of the explanatory 
# variables), and the alternate, Ha: at least one of the non-constant 
# coefficientsin the regression equation is non-zero. If the model has 
# more parameters, the F-test wil have a high p-value. If the model 
# with more parameters is better than the model with fewer parameters, 
# you will have a lower p-value. 
# * DF (degrees of freedom) pertains to how many variables are 
# in the model.
